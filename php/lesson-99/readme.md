This is my version of the AlphaNet. 

I made it so you can easily edit the background and foreground color of your card. Just go into the [JSON file](https://github.com/jose-negrete/pe-websites/edit/master/php/lesson-99/students.json) and find your object and look for the code similar to the example below.

```
	"bgColor": "{{ INPUT BACKGROUND COLOR }}",
	"fgColor": "{{ INPUT FOREGROUND COLOR }}"
```

Make sure to remove the curly braces. Don't delete the double quotes. 
Capeesh?
