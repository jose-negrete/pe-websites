			<h2>Dig the Sun! Drink the Water!</h2>
			
			<p>Howdy there folks! Welcome to Intergalactic Plant World!</p>
			
			<p class="last-p">In case you didn’t know already, we grow and sell succulents. Extremely cool and colorful ones too. Really wild to stare at when you’re peaking. Sometimes we’ll go to the junkyard and find some weird unconventional items to make a planter out of. Beyond the plants, we’re also a place for the community come and hang out. Bored? Got nothing to do? Stop in! Say hi!</p>

			<h2>Come one, come all…</h2>
			
			<p>Got your own plant store? Cool! We’re happy to sell to you as well as a the general public.</p>
			
			<p>We’re pretty informal here at Intergalactic. All prices are sliding scale based on your needs. For that reason, we don’t publicly post a set price. We’re open to bartering and volunteering work in exchange for plants... but hey! If you really want a plant we’ll give you one! All we ask is that you have good vibes and break off a piece of cacti for Charlie.</p>

			<p class="last-p">We don't have a list of the different types of succulents we have in stock because, well… I don’t know? I’ve been doing this for years but never learned the proper names. I just say the cool purple one and stuff like that. We’re more so the kind of place where customers don’t know what they want til they see it. If you’re really curious and don’t have the time to stop in — just give us a call and I’ll figure it out try to find what you’re looking for.</p>

			<h2>A Tale of 3 Jims</h2>
			
			<p>You can call me Jim. In fact, you can call all 3 of us Jim. No relation. Just a strange coincidence. To spare us the confusion please call me (the one with the fanny pack) Jim 1, the one with the lion’s mane Jim 2, and the sketchy lurker in the back Jim 3. Collectively known as psychedelic ZZ-Top.</p>
			
			<p>We first met at the original Burning Man back in 1986. You know, back when it was pure. Back before all you millennial techies ruined it! Sorry. Anyways, that’s where our story begins. After that we kept seeing each other around the hack circles and eventually became the best of friends.</p>
			
			<p>Believe it not, Jim 2 used to be a marine. That’s right… and as luck would have it he got stationed at Twentynine Palms of all places. Coming from Minnesota, he was immediately enamored with all the beautiful plants, the desert bloom, you know — all that jazz. So he got his first succulent, then 1 became 2, and 2 became a ginormous field. Things would eventually get too out of control so he asked his trusty friends (1 and 3) to give him a hand. I'm proud to say that Intergalactic Plant World has been going strong for nearly 20 years now!</p>
			
			<p>Oh yeah, don’t forget to say hi to Charlie when you stop in!</p>

			<h2>Why Ashland?</h2>

			<p class="last-p">In the summer of ’95 we decided to take a road trip in the old VW from our Bungalow in Bolinas. All was fine and dandy til we got to Roseburg, OR. Boring little nothing town off the i-5. So we were driving when all of a sudden a deer came out of nowhere and totaled Shirley (our VW). There was no way in hell we could salvage the car so we decided to abandon it, use the money we had for the road trip, and get a hostel in the nearest city which just so happens to be beautiful Ashland, Oregon. We instantly felt connected to the land and saw that it was fate that we belonged here.</p>

			<h2>Sound Bath Sundays</h2>

			<div class="events-container last-p">
				<div>
					<p>These are really fun. Sort of a secret thing though. Ask us about it. We’re really selective about who we let into this community. The process of initiation is pretty strenuous so only ask us if you’re serious about it.</p>
