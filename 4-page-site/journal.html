<article>
	<p>About a year ago I did a ton of research and self-examination to find out what my next step should be. I made list after list of what I want/need, took multiple personality tests, consulted the trolls at Reddit, and had a lot of embarrassing moments alone in the woods. After all that I somehow landed on becoming a web developer.</p>

	<p>I originally started out on the self-taught path using various resources like freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, Udemy, etc. got comfortable using the very basics of the main front-end languages. Although I had some success I would always hit a wall at some point and wouldn’t code for a month or more at a time. Eventually I would regain confidence and start from scratch again. This has happened like 4 times now.</p>

	<p>I came to the realization that I couldn’t do this alone so I started investigating all the bootcamps out there. I was always a little skeptical of them because I would always find conflicting information in my research. Then I came across this video. It was hilarious and also confirmed my suspicions. Who is this dude?</p>

	<p>Enter Perpetual Education.</p>

	<p>After watching that video I decided to look into their program, Design for the Web. I got the impression that it was completely different from the other bootcamps out there. I wouldn’t even lump it in with the other bootcamps. The layout of the course isn’t overwhelming at all. Just one lesson for 3 hours a day so you can solely focus and retain what you learned as opposed to the other bootcamps that just bombard you with 10 hours of dry (extremely dry) information a day. The course takes 6 months as opposed to the standard 3 months. Much more practical. What’s really cool is that you can start the program without a clear vision of what exact role you want and discover what speaks to you in the process.</p>

	<p>Long story short, I started the program 4 days ago and it has been really interesting so far.</p>
