					<p>The first step in addressing gentrification is understanding where it has happened and where it is likely to happen in the future. A number of cities have found mapping to be a powerful tool for observing gentrification trends, allowing them to intervene before low-income residents are seriously affected. Cities have created maps using data mostly from public sources both to better understand historical trends in gentrification and displacement and predict the next areas where low-income residents are likely to lose their homes.</p>

This index serves as an exploratory tool, providing residents and municipal employees alike with an accessible patform for information on gentrification. the visualization empowers users to conduct their own analyses in order to understand geospatial trends that can inform interventions.</p>
