The unwanted nature of sexual harassment distinguishes it from flirtatious or sexual behavior, which is entered into freely and mutually. It is the damaging impact of the unwanted behavior on the recipient, not the intention of the harasser, which counts. The impact of sexual harassment is taken into account when cases of sexual harassment are investigated.",
